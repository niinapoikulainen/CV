Hi viewer,

My name is Niina Poikulainen and currently I'm working as a PMO trainee at Airbus and finishing my master's degree in BIZ, Aalto University.
I'm interested in sustainability topics, process development, change, customer experience and relationships, meaningful KPI measurements and development,
product development and innovation, leading people and teams, technology and project management.
